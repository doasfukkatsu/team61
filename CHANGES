0.2 Bobtail

new features and enhancements:
* turn timer: The time for each turn can be limited.
* rampage: Figures which are on a rampage (ie. caused more than 75 hp damage) get a 30 hp shield and greater resistance against shock waves until their next turn; after the next turn, the figure gets a hp bonus basing upon the caused damage and the shield left.
* local game: Teams can be removed.
* The game can be started even if it is saved in a read-only directory (eg. on a CD; customizing parts do not work).

fixed problems:
* bananabomb: correct calculation of random x value for initial velocity of shards
* rifle: the pointer was too short when aiming up (#117)
* network game: sometimes it was possible for all players to control the current figure (#113)
* loading saved game: loading a saved game with dead figures was not possible (#114)
